## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains the four major projects I built during my **SkillCraft Internship**, focusing on **Cybersecurity**, **Encryption**, and **Ethical Hacking** fundamentals.  

Each project demonstrates key aspects of security and cryptography — from classical encryption to modern password analysis — built using **Python** and industry-standard libraries.

## 🧩 Projects

### 1. 🔐 Caesar Cipher
A classic text encryption algorithm that shifts letters of a message by a fixed number of positions.

**Features:**
- Encrypts and decrypts text with a custom shift value.  
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters.  
- Simple CLI-based interaction.

**Run Example:**
```bash
python CaesarCipher.py
2. 🖥️ KeyLogger (Ethical Research Demo)
⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is strictly for educational and research purposes only.
It should never be used on any system without explicit, informed consent.

Features:

Logs keystrokes in a controlled environment (sandbox or VM).

Demonstrates key-capture principles for defensive research.

Includes simulation mode for safe demo usage.

Run Example (safe simulated mode):

bash
Copy code
python KeyLogger.py --simulate
3. 💪 Password Strength Checker
A tool to evaluate the strength of user passwords and suggest improvements.

Features:

Checks for length, character variety, and common patterns.

Rates password security level (Weak / Moderate / Strong).

Provides actionable feedback for stronger passwords.

Run Example:

bash
Copy code
python PasswordStrength.py
4. 🧬 Pixel Encryption
An image encryption script that transforms pixel data using symmetric encryption techniques.

Features:

Encrypts and decrypts images using a user-provided key.

Demonstrates visual encryption with reversible transformations.

Uses Pillow (PIL) for image handling.

Run Example:

bash
Copy code
python PixelEncryption.py
⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AryanThakur04/Skill-Craft-Intership.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Skill-Craft-Intership
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run any project as shown above.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
During this internship, I:

Gained hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms and data security.

Learned about ethical hacking principles and responsible tool development.

Practiced Python scripting, file I/O, GUI basics, and image processing.

Focused on writing clean, documented, and ethically aware code.

⚖️ Ethics & Legal Notice
Some tools (like the KeyLogger) have potential for misuse.
They are included here only for educational and ethical cybersecurity research.
Do not deploy, distribute, or execute any monitoring code on machines without explicit consent.

🧰 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Libraries: pynput, Pillow, hashlib, os, argparse, random

Would you like me to make it include **badges** (for Python version, license, repo stars, etc.) and a **preview image banner** for your GitHub profile?  
That makes it look more professional.
